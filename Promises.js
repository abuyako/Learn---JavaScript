// // PROMISES
// Promises is the placeholder for something in the future. 
// So Promises help us in a Asynchronous programming. 

// We have multiple activities happen in out application 
//  connect();
//  dbCall();
//  restCall();

//  Each one of them synchronous at  runtime, if one of them take a lot of time we can excute on of them and other parallel
//  before the promises we have a callback function myCallBack(); to call the other. 
 
//  better error Handling.
